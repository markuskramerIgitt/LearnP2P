#### DHT and PEX
[DHT is BEP05](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html) (2008-2020), [PEX is BEP11](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0011.html) (2015-2017).

DHT is intended to bootstrap/discover peers/swarms.


PEX is intended to reflect which peers a client is currently connected to, PEX provides better liveness information than DHT
